**Importing Maven project to Eclipse**

Since project is now using Maven build tool, everyone should delete it localy,
clone repository again and import in Eclipse as "Existing Maven project".

Steps to import Maven project into Eclipse are mentioned here: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36242422/2510775)

**.editorconfig**

There's added configuration for editorconfig plugin. It will guarantee same formatting style for all working on project.
It will prevent situation when files in commits looks like they were whole edited because of e.g. different indentation style.
You can find plugin here: [editorconfig-eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/editorconfig-eclipse)
After installation you need to restart eclipse. After that, when you autoformat your code, it will take rules from .editorconfig file.
